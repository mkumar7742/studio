# TrackWise - A Firebase Studio Project

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with `create-next-app`, designed and built in Firebase Studio.

This project is a frontend-only application using mock data. It is structured to be easily connected to a custom backend.

## Getting Started

To get the development environment running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Open your terminal in the project root and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the Development Server**:
    Once the installation is complete, start the Next.js development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  **View Your App**:
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the main page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
